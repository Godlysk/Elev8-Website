Teaching is an experience like no other. We were thrilled when we got the opportunity to train 10 mentors from 6 different NGOs. While this was an incredibly daunting task, we gave it our all! We witnessed immense excitement and were really engaged! Finally at the end of 8 weeks, watching them coming up with their own designs, curriculums and ideas restored our faith in our hard work.
