We at Team Elev8 strive to provide equal opportunities to everyone. With inclusiveness at the heart of our outreach model, we started our She Empowers STEM program. We conducted robotics workshops with 80+ girls from grades 5-9 in our school. We started an all-girls FTC team with passionate and highly driven girls. We held a webinar to empower the women of tomorrow. Lastly, we also conducted a webinar for the under-privileged girls to create awareness about the limitless opportunities.
